    "* Ahmed is a customer of Sastaticket.pk. He is planning to fly from Karachi to Islamabad for his brother's wedding and is currently i the process of choosing tickets. Ahmed has to go to Islamabad but Ahmed also wants to svae some money in the process, so he chooses to wait instead of buy now, simply beacuse ticket prices are just too high.\n",
    "* Is this the right decision? Won't ticket increase in the future? Perhaps there is a sweet-spot Ahmed is hoping to find and mayber he just might find it. This is the problem that you will be tackling in the competition.\n",
    "* Can you predict future prices accurately tosucha degree that you can now tell Ahmed - with confidence - that he has made the wrong decision. Your task boils down to generating optimal predictions for flight prices of multiple airlines. If successfull, your model will contribute greatly to Sastaticket's rich and diverse set of operating algorithms.   "
